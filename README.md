# PySWITCH

PySWITCH allows you to communicate with FreeSWITCH using
inbound and outbound EventSocket connections.

The protocols are designed to be included in applications that
want to allow for multi-protocol communication using the Twisted
protocol.  Their integration with FreeSWITCH does not require any
modification to the FreeSWITCH source code (though an eventsocket
account is obviously required for the Inbound connections, and you
have to actually call the Outbound server from the dialplan).
